# 🔧 Common Problems/Troubleshooting
## The VC doesn't get deleted when I join another vc!
1. Duplicate update-12.js

2. Go to the file and then go to line 6 and change the `${process.env.lobby_id}` to the voice channel ID that you joined that wouldn't delete the Custom VC

3. Then save! (If you have multiple VCs then do the same steps!)
